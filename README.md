# deepthink

Advanced deep thinking skill for Claude Code - enables rigorous, structured reasoning for complex problems.

## What is this?

This skill triggers advanced structured reasoning before answering questions. It follows a strict multi-layer protocol to:
- Minimize hallucinations
- Explore alternatives
- Achieve high-confidence answers

## Features

- **Problem Decomposition** - Break complex queries into logical sub-problems
- **Multi-Layer Thinking** - Understand → Plan → Execute → Verify cycle
- **Self-Questioning Loop** - Challenge your assumptions with 6+ deep questions
- **Tool Integration** - Search/verify uncertain facts instead of guessing
- **Structured Output** - Clear conclusions with confidence levels

## Installation

### Method 1: Clone to skills directory

```bash
# Clone to your Claude Code skills directory
git clone https://github.com/wxhou/deepthink.git ~/.claude/skills/deepthink
```

### Method 2: Using Plugin (if available)

```bash
/plugin install deepthink-marketplace
```

## Usage

When you want deep analysis, use the `/deepthink` command:

```
/deepthink Your question here
```

Or alternatively:

```
/think Your question here
/depthink Your question here
```

## How it works

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Break query into sub-problems
2. **Multi-Layer Thinking** - Understand → Plan → Execute → Verify
3. **Self-Questioning** - Challenge assumptions with 6+ questions
4. **Tool Verification** - Search/verify uncertain facts
5. **Structured Output** - Conclusion + Confidence Level + Limitations

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI
- `sequentialthinking` MCP - **Built-in, no installation needed**

## Examples

```
/deepthink 如何设计一个高效的消息队列系统？
→ Decompose: 架构→持久化→高可用→性能优化
→ Plan: 对比 Kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis
→ Execute: 搜索最新方案
→ Self-question: 瓶颈在哪? 扩展性?
→ Output with confidence level

/deepthink 分析当前AI Agent的发展趋势
→ Search latest developments
→ Verify claims with sources
→ Structured timeline output
→ Confidence: High
```

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to install sequentialthinking separately?
**A: No!** The `sequentialthinking` MCP is built into Claude Code. Just install this skill and it will work.

### Q: Does this run automatically on every question?
**A:** No. You must explicitly invoke with `/deepthink`. Claude Code doesn't support "pre-response hooks" yet.
